## Compile the code
First make sure that `nvcc` is available to use as a compiler. To compile to code simply type `make` in the home directory.

## Run the code
The compiled program is stored in the `/bin` folder. It takes as a required argument the path to the `.mtx` file.

## Resources
All the `.mtx` files in the `/dataset` folder were found on https://sparse.tamu.edu/
